* About
A set of tiny functions to keep the ~meson.build~ files for OpenBLAS in sync
with the corresponding ~Makefiles~.
** Why
For testing the constituent regular expressions and to keep a single notebook to
help construct paired build systems.
** Usage
The documentation consists of notebooks which can be taken as a rough chart of
potring away from ~Makefiles~ and ~CMake~.
