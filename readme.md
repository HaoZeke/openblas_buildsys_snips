# About

A set of tiny functions to keep the `meson.build` files for OpenBLAS in sync
with the corresponding `Makefiles`.


<a id="org7f80375"></a>

## Why

For testing the constituent regular expressions and to keep a single notebook to
help construct paired build systems.


<a id="org47d4785"></a>

## Usage

The documentation consists of notebooks which can be taken as a rough chart of
potring away from `Makefiles` and `CMake`.
