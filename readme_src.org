* About
A set of tiny functions to keep the ~meson.build~ files for OpenBLAS in sync
with the corresponding ~Makefiles~.
** Why
For testing the constituent regular expressions and to keep a single notebook to
help construct paired build systems.
** Usage
The documentation consists of notebooks which can be taken as a rough chart of
porting away from ~Makefiles~ and ~CMake~.

While the library can be installed via ~pip~ and then used in scripts, that
would be rather odd at this point in its developement. The idea is to mostly
generate snippets and copy them into ~meson.build~ files by hand for now, later
these can form the basis of a templated system for automating updates further.
** Documentation
*** Readme
The ~readme~ can be constructed via:
#+begin_src bash
./scripts/org_to_md.sh readme_src.org readme.md
#+end_src
